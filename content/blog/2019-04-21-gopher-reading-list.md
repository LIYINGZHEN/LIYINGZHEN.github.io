Here is a reading list of blog posts about [Go](https://golang.org). It aspires
to include only the most useful and relevant material that anyone writing Go
should eventually read. By definition, the list is a work in progress.

Rather than being comprehensive, the list is a curated selection fixed at 200
entries.

Go is growing fast and so are the number of blog posts about it. If an
interested reader knows of a great post not on this list, please open an issue
with a link to the post.
