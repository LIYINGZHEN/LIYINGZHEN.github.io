## Favor Simplicity

Favor simplicity in everything that you do.

## Test First, Test Everything

Employ Test-Driven Development. Test everything, everywhere.

Fear is the direct result of lack of testing.

## Release Early, Release Often

Every checkin is a potential production release, deployed via CD pipeline.

## Automate Everything

Everything that can be automated, should be automated.

## Build Service Ecosystems

Everything is a service, including your application.
