# Monolith V.S Microservices Architecture

1. Maintenance

- Monolith

  Maintenance grows in complexity as the application does.

- Microservices

  It is easier to maintain microservices, as they are modular and independent.

2. Deployment

- Monolith

  Continuous deployment becomes very difficult as the monolith keeps growing.

- Microservices

  Deployment of individual services is easier, and services can be deployed as and when required.

3. Testing

- Monolith

  Testing the entire monolith becomes a pain.

- Microservices

  Testing individual components is much easier.

4. Startup time

- Monolith

  As the monolith grows in size, the startup time increases with it.

- Microservices

  Startup times of individual services are much faster, because they are smaller in size.

5. Adoption of newer technologies

- Monolith

  A monolith is written in a single language, uses a single database, and is averse to adopting newer technologies.

- Microservices

  Developers are free to choose the technologies to build their microservices. Each microservice can also use a database that best suits its needs. Microservices architecture allows you to take advantage of the latest available technologies.

6. Scalability

- Monolith

  It’s much harder to scale a complex monolith.

- Microservices

  Microservices can be scaled on demand, as and when needed.
