- Thinking of data as streams has a lot of practical uses, especially when working with network traffic or filesystems.

# Copy

```go
w := io.MultiWriter(out, os.Stdout)

if _, err := io.Copy(w, f1); err != nil {
  return err
}
```

# CopyBuffer

```go
w := io.MultiWriter(out, os.Stdout)
buf := make([]byte, 64)
if _, err := io.CopyBuffer(w, in, buf); err != nil {
	return err
}
```
