- A process is an execution environment that contains instructions, user data and system data parts, and other types of resources that are obtained during runtime. 
- A program is a binary file that contains instructions and data that are used for initializing the instruction and user data parts of a process.
- A thread is a smaller and lighter entity than a process or a program. Threads are created by processes and have their own flow of control and stack.
