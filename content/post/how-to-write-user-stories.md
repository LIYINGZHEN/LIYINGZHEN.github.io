User stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them. All agile user stories include a written sentence or two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about the desired functionality.

## What is a user story?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

> As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

## Can you show some user story examples?

- **As a** traveler, **I want** to see the different types of journeys I can get recommendations for **so that** I can decide what kind of evening to take my partner on.
- **As a** traveler, **I want** to see a random recommendation for my selected journey type **so that** I know where to go and what the evening will entail.
