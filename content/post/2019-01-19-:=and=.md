The official name for `:=` is the **short assignment statement**. The short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with an implicit type.

> The var keyword is mostly used for declaring global variables in Go programs as well as for declaring variables without an initial value. The reason for the former is that every statement that exists outside of the code of a function must begin with a keyword, such as func or var. This means that the short assignment statement cannot be used outside of a function because it is not available there.
