# 2.3. Zero Value

# 2.6.2. Package Initialization

Programs initialize and begin execution from the `main` package. If the `main` package imports other packages, they will be imported in the compile time. If one package is imported many times, it will be only compiled once. After importing packages, programs will initialize the constants and variables within the imported packages, then execute the `init` function if it exists, and so on. After all the other packages are initialized, programs will initialize constants and variables in the `main` package, then execute the `init` function inside the package if it exists. The following figure shows the process.

# 5. Methods

> "A method is a function with an implicit first argument, called a receiver."

# 6.2. Methods with a Pointer Receiver

In a realistic program, convention dictates that if any method of Point has a pointer receiver, then all methods of Point should have a pointer receiver, even ones that don’t strictly need it.

> Remember to always close channels in producers and not in consumers, or it's very easy to get into panic status.

# new() and make()

1. The builtin new(T) function allocates “zeroed” storage for a new item of type T and returns its address, a value of type *T.

```go
// Allocate enough memory to store a bytes.Buffer value
// and return a pointer to the value's address.
var buf bytes.Buffer
p := &buf

// Use a composite literal to perform allocation and
// return a pointer to the value's address.
p := &bytes.Buffer{}

// Use the new function to perform allocation, which will
// return a pointer to the value's address.
p := new(bytes.Buffer)
```

2. The make() function, on the other hand, is a special built-in function that is used to initialize `slices`, `maps`, and `channels`.

```go
// Using make() to initialize a map.
m := make(map[string]bool, 0)

// Using a composite literal to initialize a map.
m := map[string]bool{}
```
