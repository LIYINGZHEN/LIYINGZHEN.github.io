- A channel is a communication mechanism that allows goroutines to exchange data, among other things.

# Writing to a channel

The code in this subsection will teach you how to write to a channel. Writing the x value to the c channel is as easy as writing c <- x.

# Reading from a channel

In this subsection, you will learn how to read from a channel. You can read a single value from a channel named c by executing <-c.

# Channels as function parameters

send-only channel

receive-only channel

```go
func f1(out chan<- int64, in <-chan int64) {
}
```
