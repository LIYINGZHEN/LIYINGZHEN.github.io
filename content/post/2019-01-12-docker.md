```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/src -p 8080:8080 -w /src golang:alpine /bin/sh
```

- `--rm` The --rm flag tells the Docker engine to remove the container and delete any resources such as volumes it was using on exit.
- `--it` The -it flags stand for interactive terminal it maps the standard in from your terminal to the input of the running container.
- `-v` The -v, or --volume parameter allows you to specify a pair of values corresponding to the file system you wish to mount on the host and the path where you would like to mount the volume inside the container.
- `-p`
- `-w` The -w flag we are passing is to set the working directory that means that any command we run in the container will be run inside this folder.
