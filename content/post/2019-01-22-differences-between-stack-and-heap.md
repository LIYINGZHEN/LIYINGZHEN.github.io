Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation, both stored in the computer's RAM .

# Stack

- Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access to this memory is very fast, and it's allocation is dealt with when the program is compiled.

# Heap

- Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing this memory is a bit slower.
