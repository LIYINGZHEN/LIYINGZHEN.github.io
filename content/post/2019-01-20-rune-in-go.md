A rune is an int32 value, and therefore it is a Go type that is used for representing a Unicode code point. A Unicode code point or code position is a numerical value that is usually used for representing single Unicode characters.

> NOTE: You can consider a string as a collection of runes.

A **rune literal** is a character in single quotes. You may also consider a rune literal as a **rune constant**. Behind the scenes, a rune literal is associated with a Unicode code point.
