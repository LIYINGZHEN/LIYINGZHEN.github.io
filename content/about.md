Hey, I'm Max. I am a software engineer with 3+ years of experience
working on-site and remotely. I have worked on and launched several
production-grade applications. I have a strong background in
developing React.js, Node.js and Golang and I
can easily adapt to various types of projects and architectures.

I am flexible to project demands and shifting of priorities. I
thrive in unfamiliar situations and enjoy opportunities to learn and
gain exposure to new ideas and experiences. I am open and willing to
learn whatever is necessary to accomplish my client's goals.

To sum up briefly I would say that I'm a passionate explorer willing
to change the world and to make it more comfortable with the idea of
automation in each aspect of life.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I spend my time exercising, learning,
experimenting, traveling, and listening to music.
