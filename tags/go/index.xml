      <description>Here is a reading list of blog posts about Go. It aspires to include only the most useful and relevant material that anyone writing Go should eventually read. By definition, the list is a work in progress.
Rather than being comprehensive, the list is a curated selection fixed at 200 entries.
Go is growing fast and so are the number of blog posts about it. If an interested reader knows of a great post not on this list, please open an issue with a link to the post.</description>
